<h4>Purpose</h4>

I was glad when they said to me,<br>
    “Let us go to the house of the Lord!”

Our feet have been standing <br/>
    within your gates, O Jerusalem!

Jerusalem — built as a city <br/>
    that is bound firmly together,

to which the tribes go up, <br/>
    the tribes of the Lord,

as was decreed for Israel, to give thanks <br/>
    to the name of the Lord.

There thrones for judgment were set, <br/>
    the thrones of the house of David.

<h4>Prayer</h4>

Pray for the peace of Jerusalem! <br/>
    “May they be secure who love you!

Peace be within your walls <br/>
    and security within your towers!”

For my brothers and companions' sake <br/>
    I will say, “Peace be within you!”

For the sake of <br/>
    the house of the Lord our God, <br/>
    I will seek your good.

[Psalm 122 (ESV)](# "ref")
