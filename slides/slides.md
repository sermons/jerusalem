<h4>Propulsion</h4>

I was **glad** when they said to me,<br>
    “Let us go to the **house of the Lord**!”

Our feet have been standing <br/>
    within your **gates**, O Jerusalem!

Jerusalem — built as a city <br/>
    that is **bound** firmly together,

to which the **tribes** go up, <br/>
    the tribes of the Lord,

as was **decreed** for Israel, to give **thanks** <br/>
    to the name of the Lord.

There **thrones** for **judgment** were set, <br/>
    the thrones of the **house of David**.

</div>
<div>
<h4>Prayer</h4>

Pray for the **peace** of Jerusalem! <br/>
    “May they be **secure** who love you!

Peace be within your **walls** <br/>
    and security within your **towers**!”

For my **brothers** and companions' sake <br/>
    I will **say**, “Peace be within you!”

For the sake of <br/>
    the **house of the Lord** our God, <br/>
    I will **seek** your good.

  + "Let's go to **worship** God"
+ Takes us **out** of everyday

---
Call the Sabbath a **delight** <br/>
    and the holy day of the Lord **honorable**;

if you **honor** it, not going your **own ways**, <br/>
    or seeking your own pleasure, or talking idly

[Isaiah 58:13 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ delight: **lightweight**, fun

(v2)

>>>

(v3-4a)

>>>
+ **bound** firmly together: compact
+ Jeru. literally is compact

>>>
+ Taking time to meet together is
  + not just a **decree**

You shall observe this **rite** as a statute <br/>
for you and for your sons forever. 

... And when your **children** say to you, <br/>
