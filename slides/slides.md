and what does the Lord **require** of you

but to do **justice**, and to love **kindness**, <br/>
and to walk **humbly** with your God?

<h4>Purpose</h4>

I was **glad** when they said to me,<br>
    “Let us go to the **house of the Lord**!”

Our feet have been standing <br/>
    within your **gates**, O Jerusalem!

Jerusalem — built as a city <br/>
    that is **bound** firmly together,

to which the **tribes** go up, <br/>
    the tribes of the Lord,

as was **decreed** for Israel, to give **thanks** <br/>
    to the name of the Lord.

There **thrones** for **judgment** were set, <br/>
    the thrones of the **house of David**.
