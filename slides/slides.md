<div class="imgbox fulltext">

I was **glad** when they said to me,<br>
    “Let us go to the **house of the Lord**!”

Our feet have been standing <br/>
    within your **gates**, O Jerusalem!

Jerusalem — built as a city <br/>
    that is **bound** firmly together,

to which the **tribes** go up, <br/>
    the tribes of the Lord,

as was **decreed** for Israel, to give **thanks** <br/>
    to the name of the Lord.

There **thrones** for **judgment** were set, <br/>
    the thrones of the **house of David**.

</div>
<div>

Pray for the **peace** of Jerusalem! <br/>
    “May they be **secure** who love you!

Peace be within your **walls** <br/>
    and security within your **towers**!”

For my **brothers** and companions' sake <br/>
    I will **say**, “Peace be within you!”

For the sake of <br/>
    the **house of the Lord** our God, <br/>
    I will **seek** your good.

-- Psalm 122 (ESV)
