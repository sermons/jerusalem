I was **glad** when they said to me,<br>
    “Let us go to the **house of the Lord**!”

Our feet have been standing <br/>
    within your **gates**, O Jerusalem!

Jerusalem — built as a city <br/>
    that is **bound** firmly together,

to which the **tribes** go up, <br/>
    the tribes of the Lord,

as was **decreed** for Israel, to give **thanks** <br/>
    to the name of the Lord.

There **thrones** for **judgment** were set, <br/>
    the thrones of the **house of David**.

</div>
<div>

Pray for the **peace** of Jerusalem! <br/>
    “May they be **secure** who love you!

Peace be within your **walls** <br/>
    and security within your **towers**!”

For my **brothers** and companions' sake <br/>
    I will **say**, “Peace be within you!”

For the sake of <br/>
    the **house of the Lord** our God, <br/>
    I will **seek** your good.

-- Psalm 122 (ESV)

Stand in the gate of the Lord's house, and proclaim there this word, and say, Hear the word of the Lord, all you men of Judah who enter these gates to worship the Lord. 3 Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Amend your ways and your deeds, and I will let you dwell in this place. 4 Do not trust in these deceptive words: ‘This is the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord.’

Jeremiah 7:2-4 (ESV)

The hour is coming when neither on this **mountain** <br/>
nor in **Jerusalem** will you worship the Father

the true worshipers will worship the Father <br/>
in **spirit and truth**

John 4:21,23 (ESV)
